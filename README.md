## Preparing for inhouses (1 time thing)  

1. Users that want to join must register their summoner ids via `/inhouse-register <name>`  
   a. Users will verify that their account belongs to them by us requesting that they change their icon to one of the default icons.  
      i. We'll have to make sure that the icon we select is not already in use by the account.  
   b. Once their icon is changed, they can react to the command and we will verify.

      i. If they don't we'll remove their reaction (and name from list) and we'll send a DM saying they need to register a summoner.  
6. When 10 players have joined, a ready check will begin in which all 10 players must click the ready reaction.  
   a. An organizer can override the check by typing `/inhouse-forcestart`  
   b. The ready check will be part of the same embedded message.
